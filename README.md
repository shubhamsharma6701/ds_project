🎓 Student Math Score Prediction
This project predicts student math scores based on various parameters using machine learning regression and classification models. Additionally, it features a Flask web application to interactively predict and classify math scores.

📌 Project Overview
Use machine learning models to predict math scores.

Classify student performance into categories.

Deploy a Flask app for easy user interaction.

📂 Dataset
Includes features like gender, parental education, test preparation, lunch type, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

🧠 Machine Learning Models
Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor

Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

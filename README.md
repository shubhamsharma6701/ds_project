# Prediction of Math Scores (End-to-end Project)

Performed prediction of Mathematics Test Scores based on Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Type of Lunch, Status of Test Preparation Course, Reading Score and Writing Score.

A series of regression and classification models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, KNN, XGB Regressor, Cat Boosting Regressor and Ada Boost Regressor models along with the hyperparameter tuning of each of these models was done to find out the best R2-score among all.
